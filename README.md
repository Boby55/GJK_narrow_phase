# GJK: narrow phase collision detection 

## Requirements
**Two 2D convex poly-line objects**\n
-Implement object definition
-either read line segment positions from text file
-or implement user interface to create poly-line by clicking on canvas
Implement 2D Proximity GJK algorithm
**Implement method ClosestPoint() on simplex**
-Implement method SupportHC() for Hill Climbing support function
-Implement method 2D BestSimplex() for simplex refinement (simpler case as in 3D)
**Implement user interaction with object**
-User can move object (rotation is optional)
-Show closest points (features) on both geometries
